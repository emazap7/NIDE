# Quickstart
Clone this repository locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/emazap7/Neural_IDE.git
```


Create an Anaconda environment from the `environment.yml` file using:

```
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate neural_ide
```

# Datasets

## Toy data 
The toy data has been obtained by solving analytical IDEs in 2D and 4Ds. The kernels used in both cases were convolutional kernels where the entries were given by combinations of trigonometric functions. The F function was a hyperbolic cosine. To obtain the datasets, we have randomly sampled initial conditions and solved the corresponding initial value problem for the IDEs, using our implementation of the IDE solver. The integrals have been performed with Monte-Carlo integration with 1K sampled points per interval, and the number of iterations used was set to 10, which was empirically seen to guarantee convergence to the solution.

The scripts for the toy data generation can be found [here](resources/NIDE_method_github.png).
